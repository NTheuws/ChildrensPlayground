# Children's Playground
## Why?
This project was requested by Natlab to Fontys, Open Learning. The issue they were dealing was was as follows: After kids have been watched a movie and their parents/grandparents wanted to sit down and have a drink after. The kids would be too energetic and start running around, annoying other visitors. Something had to be created to entertain the kids so their parents could relax which is why the project "Children's playground". This is a proof of concept of that.

## What is it?
This take on the playground is creating a platformer game where the kids have to move their own body in order to move their character in the game. it consists of multiple platforms on different levels which the plays can jump on in order to collect points and avoid obstacles and can be played with up to 4 players.

## What does it do?
Right now the game consists of an intro scene, tutorial, the game itself and a score screen.
The tutorial explains he basic interactions the game has to offer like:
- Jumping/Ducking
- Moving left/right
- Losing/scoring points

The game itself gives you 120s to collect as many points as possible, the scoring will be a collection of all players who are playing at the same time. If someone loses points it also means the collective loses them. The platforms and placements of points/obstacles are randomized to some degree to make sure the level is never exactly the same.
Points are shaped as movie tickets, each of them give 1 point.
Obstacles are in the form of movieclippers, avoid those. If you dont manage 3 points will be deducted.
The platforms come in 2 shapes, being:
- full platforms; these cannot be jumped through by the players.
- Bridges; the players can jump through and land on those, but also when they duck they'll fall through them.

During the game people can join and it'll just add another character into the mix which they get to play as, but also leave the game in which case their character dissapears making sure the others can continue playing as much as they want.

## What do I need?
For this project a couple of things have been used and will be neccesary to be able to play.
- A Kinect; this is used to see the players move around and let their character move in game.
- A laptop/pc; used to play the game on.
- A beamer+wall/big screen; Connected to the pc and is used so the players can see the game.

## Setup and restrictions
The setup is fairly simple, make sure the players can see the screen on which the game will be displayed on. Then place the Kinect in front of the screen and make sure it points towards the players.
Footsteps illustrate the players, the screen and Kinect are self explanatory:

A couple of things to keep in mind are:
- If you're using a beamer make sure the Kinect is not placed in the area it projects onto as this can interfere with the sensor.
- If you're using a beamer make sure the wall is flat so the game wont be distorted.
- Make sure to have enough space between the players and the Kinect, 4m is prefered.
- When using a screen instead of a beamer make sure the screen is of decent size since the game itself is fairly small.
- It's best to have another wall behind the players or make sure there's no one walked behind them since it'll interfere with the game.

## How do I get started?
#### Editing in Unity
#### Playing the game
